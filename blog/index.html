    <h2> 2011. 03. 05. - A better zordzman command line story </h2>
    <p>
        Lately I have been frustrated by the zordzman command line story.
        It is obnoxious. It doesn't even have the slightest hint of usability.
        Whoever designed it must have been high.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we want zorroman to have even the slightest chance to succeed, we need a good command
        line story.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been thinking for a while on how to solve this problem, and I have come to the
        conclusion that it basically boils down to two factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Negregation </li>
        <li> Seduction </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By negregation, of course I mean the assessment of the blackness of the command line
        interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now what do I mean by seduction?
    </p>
    <p>
        For that to make sense, we need to look back at the evolution of zorromon.

    </p>
    <p>
        For over two months, I have analyzed the video frame by frame, and come to an earth shattering
        realization:
    </p>
    <h1> THERE IS TOO MUCH SPLIT BETWEEN THE SUBPROJECTS </h1>
    <p>
        Think about it this way: If two subprojects meet, which one is the dominant project, and
        which one is the submissive?
        There is no way to decide it. The only way they can converge is to SEDUCE eachother.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore I propose the following command line arguments:
        <ul>
        <li>--reduce</li>
        <li>--reuse</li>
        <li>--deduce</li>
        <li>--introduce</li>
        <li>--produce</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope these new command line flags will provide an overall better command line story. Thanks for your attention!
